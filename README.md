# This Might Hurt tarot image and description scraper
Gets the images and descriptions of the very wonderful [This Might Hurt tarot deck](https://www.thismighthurttarot.com/). This script:
- Crawls all five “Card Descriptions” pages (Major Arcana, Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles)
- Extracts: Card, Suit/Arcana, Subtitle (if any), Description text, and Image URL
- Saves a Notion-ready CSV and an optional images/ folder of downloaded card art

Big thanks to [Isabella Rotman](https://www.isabellarotman.com/) for making such a beautiful deck.
